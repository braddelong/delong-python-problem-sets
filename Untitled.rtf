hello everybody and really excited uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah for this this next hour so uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fireside chat as you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 may have picked up from my um my\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 video background\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um behind me um we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm sahil for those who don't know me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i look after the venture design team at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 founders factory we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 designed the new ventures which we build\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in in our in our studio\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i was saying to phil a minute ago\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we've often looked with envy at um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at all turtles as maybe you know uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 probably a leading example of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of product of a product studio um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know maybe the most kind of uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most recent and and perhaps the most\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 famous example of that is um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the yeah the the the app which\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we're both using right now and which is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of you know lending us this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fireside um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 behind us which has just raised 36\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 million dollars from sequoia and kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who's who of uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our venture capitalists in the united\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 states and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know for most people that would be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something of a career highlight i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for phil this is this is his fifth uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startup\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think yeah the the first one was in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 1997 the sort of start of the dot-com\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 boom\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people were discussing you know how big\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is this internet thing going to be is it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 two percent of the company is there 25\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 percent of companies that sort of go on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so he's he's kind of you know um he's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 been around since very beginning\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you then went on to found and was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ceo of evernote which kind of pioneered\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 personal productivity space is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 probably you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a huge number of them now evernote was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the the first and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah first example of that um then went\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on to general catalyst\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 where where he was um managing director\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i believe\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before leaving there to start all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 turtles this product studio so um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's been been around the houses a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 little bit and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm really looking forward to yeah we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 look forward to this conversation so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thank you for looking forward to this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thank you so yeah that was a very very\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 generous introduction thanks for the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for the chance to to talk to everyone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 brilliant well look there's there's kind\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of a lot of places we could start but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um yeah it might like kind of start from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know the most recent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or what you're working on now which\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and i think we were well i was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 certainly quite\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know the the the pace the speed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at which it was kind of released\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just felt like sort of a few days into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lockdown was quite um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 quite amazing actually i would love to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of hear your\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your sort of the story of what was the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 genesis of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and and um yeah you know also curious as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to where it's headed but maybe you could\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 start there\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well it started as a joke and we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 started working on it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in may actually we're coming up on our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one year anniversary of may 27th\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um so we're just about 11 months into it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know we all we started\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 working it fully distributed you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we'll have to work from home starting in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 march of last year um and for the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 first few weeks like it was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it wasn't boring working from home\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because it was really terrifying you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know we're all scared\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um but after you know by may like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the sheer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 day-to-day terror had like subsided and\cf0 \cb1 \

\fs24 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 tedium\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything was you know everything\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was on video everything was lame\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we were just goofing around i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just started um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know hacking around with things got\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one my friend one of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our engineers steve white to you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know prototype some stuff just really a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 way to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 show some some photos in the background\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of of zoom calls\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you just kind of went you know it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 went from there so we never intended to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make it a real product a real company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but every every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 time i kind of used even early versions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know in meetings like people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would smile people would laugh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think for many people it may have been\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like the first time they did that in a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meeting since\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know since the pandemic has started\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a few months ago so there was just a big\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of emotional\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 psychological need for something that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was that was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fun and a little positive and we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 realized pretty quickly that like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah we're kind of onto something i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 showed it to a friend of mine who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know runs a pretty big company just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 as a demo just to kind of get his advice\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like well you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what do you think we should what do you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 think we should do with this actually\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make this a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 product should we raise money and um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they tried to acquire us like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 immediately\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i was like well no because it's just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 steve you'd just be buying steve\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's really literally like nothing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 else at this point but we thought okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's enough interest there's enough\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 demand we love it ourselves so let's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 let's go make it real amazing and kind\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what's the you know what's the kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the vision for it you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you've raised not so insignificant some\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of money\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 curious has to kind of how how you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 see that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know where do you kind of go from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 here right sort of starts off as a bit\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of a joke turns into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know something yeah which is yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm not going to suggest it's serious\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's actually a really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fun and enjoyable build product\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but but yeah curious as to kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 where you where you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 see it going from from here well i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think the what we're living through\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right now in the world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is is the biggest it's the biggest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 time of change that i've ever lived\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 through like this is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know this is a more uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know a more transformational last\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 year in the next couple of years than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than ever\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know you you mentioned in your\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 introduction you know my first company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in 97 when everyone's running around\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 saying.com and you know that felt like a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like a very transformational age but um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this is much bigger\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um this like what the pandemic did was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it basically\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 accelerated multiple technologies and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 social\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 development social trends that had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 already started but it accelerated them\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 by you know ten years\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it within you know a year so over the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 next uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 over the next couple of years\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything's gonna change um and it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gonna change around this like very\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think specific way we we think the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 big the big change is happening is this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is that everything is going hybrid\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and i mean something specific by this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i mean uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if you imagine if you imagine all like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the life experiences\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like everything we do at life at work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 whatever you kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 map them on this axis between in person\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and online\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then crossed with live to record it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so you kind of make this you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 consulting you two by two\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of you know live recorded and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 personal online\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the before times you know 14 months\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ago\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 almost everything we did fit neatly into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just one of these quadrants\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so you know concerts were live and in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 person and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know founders forum was live in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 person and doctors visits were live\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a person university classes were live\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a person and you know youtube videos\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 were online and recorded and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it was very rare for for something to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 exist in multiple quadrants it was very\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rare exceptions for the most part\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every type of a thing of experience at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 work and personal life was in one of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 these places\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and what's happening now is um we get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reimagine everything like we get to we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rebuild almost everything in the world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to exist simultaneously\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 as a mix-up of live and recorded and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in person and online\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a way that's better for the thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that we're trying to reimagine\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so for example you know university\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 classes right like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can you do can you can you deliver a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more effective education\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if you weren't forcing people to always\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be in the same room in person but you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 spread it out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sometimes you would listen to things\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 asynchronously pre-recorded online\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sometimes you would have discussions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 synchronously in real time online\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sometimes you would get together in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 person these things don't have to happen\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 necessarily\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 during the same day or the same mixture\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for all people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can you do that for health care visits\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can you do that for entertainment\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know i think the answer is yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you can do it for just about everything\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the result is this you know we call\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it irl plus better than in real life\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like we can take what you can do in real\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 life and we can we can improve it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um which is basically another way of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 saying that like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we all in we spent that we all spend the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 past 14 months\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 living on video because we were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forced to be like we have to we had no\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 choice most of us\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and um it sucked because anytime you're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forced to do something you give up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 agency\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it doesn't feel good but while doing it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we invented a bunch of stuff we learned\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a bunch of things and now over the next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 couple of months\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hopefully most of the world is kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 coming to a point where we don't have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 locked up we don't have to be on video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all the time we can choose\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what to do in person and what to do in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 video and now that we have that agency\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we can do in person the stuff that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 better in person we can do on video the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stuff that's better on video we can\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 seamlessly combine those things and it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to make a bigger transformation of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the world than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know than the internet did that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super interesting actually\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because obviously you know sort of back\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in 97 where there was a debate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which seems ridiculous in retrospect\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about how much yeah the internet was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to change things now the internet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of underpins absolutely everything\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how do you kind of you know project\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forward\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know particularly given the the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 increasing pace of change\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so what's what's the world going to look\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know two three five years from now\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how's it going to be different to to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 today\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know i think what happens is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every time there's a massive uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 technological shift or change what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happens is the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the first generation of players the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 incumbent players that the people and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 companies who were kind of a big deal\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before the change happened\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and there's still a big deal immediately\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 after the change happened what they try\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to do is they try to recreate their old\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 using the new the new technology right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so for example\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know if you think about like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 first movies that were ever made right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like in the 19 teens\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um people had invented film cameras\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but they hadn't invented anything else\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about cinema so the old reality they had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was um the actors on the stage right so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that a lot of the first movies were like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you just point the camera a film camera\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at the actors on stage it was really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 awkward and kind of weird\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i'm sure there was like a lot of you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know theater critics and you know 1913\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that were like ah this newfangled cinema\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is like a terrible\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's definitely not a substitute for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 theater it'll never replace theater it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 an inferior experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know they were right um because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 cinema hadn't been invented\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because it took like it took the next 20\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 30 years for people that were native to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the invention of the camera to figure\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 out like close-ups and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 editing and multiple camera shots that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you realize that movies weren't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 weren't a replacement for the theater\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they were a totally different thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 theater still exists today movies became\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a thousand times bigger because it's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's a new thing but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but the first things think was always to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just like recreate the old reality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and it's never like a good fit like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 same thing happened you know more in my\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lifetime\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 2007 2008 when when when we were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 starting uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evernote the big change was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 smartphones you know a lot of people had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 smartphones\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but the incumbent players were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like well okay no one really knows what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 smartphone experiences are gonna be like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the incumbent players say like microsoft\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 said like you know well okay we know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what pc software is like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 pc software is like you know microsoft\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 word and a smartphone is just like a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 small pc so you know maybe smartphone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 apps should be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know small versions of microsoft\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 word and they were for a while and it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sucked and it wasn't until like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 second generation came along of you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evernote and uber\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and dropbox and airbnb that like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 invented what you could do with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 smartphones and it turns out it wasn't a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 replacement for pcs at all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it was an entirely different thing and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and it became 100 times bigger\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than pcs and then now what's happening\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is exactly the same thing the platform\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 shift is video like a lot of people have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 figured out like now now we can get\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 video working pretty well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and not just not just video at a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 distance but also like having things be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 asynchronous pre-recorded streaming like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all that stuff kind of works\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the but the first generation\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thinking the common players\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are trying to recreate the old reality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're saying like well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 okay what was the old reality the old\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reality was meetings\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so what were meetings okay well meetings\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 were a bunch of boring people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who are pretty tired because they just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sat in traffic for two hours to get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this meeting and they're sitting in a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 boring room talking about some boring\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 subjects for an hour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but now temporarily they can't all be in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the same room because of kovid\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so how do we get as close as possible to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a bunch of boring tired people sitting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a boarding room talking about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something boring for an hour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but on a computer and like yeah and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know therefore you have the first\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 generation you know video stuff\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and obviously that's not what it's going\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to be like right it's going to take\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 again people like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 us and lots of other companies to say\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the future of what you can do with video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with remixing reality is not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 trying to recreate meetings we don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 need meetings we never need it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we didn't need many of them in the first\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 place they're still going to be around\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but there'll be a much smaller thing and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this new thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is much bigger what's it gonna look like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well we're just getting glimpses of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we're i think we're figuring it out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but like the only thing we know for sure\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is that it's not gonna look anything\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like this it's not gonna look like what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people are seeing this it's not to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 us in separate boxes you know having a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 synchronous conversation like this is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 still going to happen but it's going to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be a very small\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 minority use case everything else is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to be a complete reimagining\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 very interesting and you know we've\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we've had sort of similar conversations\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you can you can see that across so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 many\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 products you know the collaboration\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 software which we sort of you know tries\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to recreate a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of whiteboard that just happens to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be in the digital space and so on and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know it's it's exciting because it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 feels like we're kind of just just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 getting started um in a whole number of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 respects\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um just just really curious quickly as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to sort of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how you see you know so yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and and what it brings to the experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 obviously there's a kind of like fun and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 joyful element you know you just kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 switched into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know old worldy kind of um well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people smile more i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 using using i think that's that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be curious as to sort of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to what degree that's kind of core to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the to the experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and also yeah it's a platform is it a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what exactly do you see it kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 becoming in you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 over time or is that already is that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of a unfair question to ask sort of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just one year into it's it's life\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah i mean as a two actually really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really you know good questions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the the the fun aspect of it yeah is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 absolutely\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um is is absolutely core um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this is um we have a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we have a a an explicit philosophy uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about this it's a it's a word that we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stole\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um it's a concept that we stole from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bistone um you know one of our investors\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a co-founder of twitter\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and um basically everything we do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every feature we add has to be fun\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and it has to be useful it has to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 both the word that we stole from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 business is useful\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um they used to do this i guess in the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 early days of twitter the test would be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if they're going to work on something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they would say is it fun\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and is it useful it has to be both\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because it has to be useful because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we're trying to make important things to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make the world better\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because if we weren't like i i wouldn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i couldn't get myself to like get out of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bed in the morning and like do the work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of making something if i didn't feel\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like it was you know worthwhile for the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 world so it's going to be useful\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but it also has to be fun because the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fun is what builds the muscle memory\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the fun is what like actually makes\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people use it and so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah like getting people to smile more\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is absolutely foundational\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to what we're trying to do especially\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to this to what we're trying to do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our insight early on was um why did\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything all of a sudden get so lame\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and ineffective on video and i kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 realized that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most of us who who who have been decent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in our jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know in the before times had figured\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 out how to be at least a little bit\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 charismatic\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and figured out how to like not bore\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everyone you you know we came in contact\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with because like you know you just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can't if you like navigate through work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just boring everyone like you're just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not gonna get very far\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so most people hadn't like thought of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that because you know they just it just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evolved over decades of of our lives but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know we kind of knew like how to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 give a presentation and how to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 talk and how to like make a little smirk\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like all the stuff without even\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thinking about it right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and but then we were all forced on video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and all sudden like no one knew how to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do any of that stuff because like being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 charismatic on video is different it's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 different skill set and we didn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we didn't all have 20 30 40 50 years to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 learn it naturally we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know we're all like okay do it next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 week\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i was just noticing how like every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every pitch i was getting on video was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super lame and not interesting and our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meetings were boring and it was just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like really hard and i thought well it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know we don't know we'd like i don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know how to be good on video we don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know how to become a video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um but then i thought well but not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everyone sucks on video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's like entire industries of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entertainers and musicians and athletes\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who know perfectly well how to be like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 captivating and engaging in video like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what do they know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what can we learn from them and how do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we how can we give everyone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 these sort of video charisma skills how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can we give that to people who don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know video production teams and you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know editing studios and all of that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stuff so that was intentionally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like our one second pitch was was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 instant weekend update right we just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 said we just want to make it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really easy for you to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 look into a camera and be engaging\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because that's important professionally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and then it's gone you know pretty\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well from that uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in terms of whether we were a platform\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or an app um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know um the it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the studio is called old turtles you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know that's from turtles all the way\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 down right so the idea is like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything everything we build we you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know we stand on the shoulders of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the people who came before us and we you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know we support the next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the people come after us and so it it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all of technology is a stack of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 platforms\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like adding new layers to that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like what starts out as an application\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 often becomes a platform so you know is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is zoom a platform or an application\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well two years ago it was definitely an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 application and the platform was aws\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or whatever whatever zoom runs on um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 now arguably zoom is a platform aws is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like also a platform\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but then like stuff like us is an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 application but in the near future\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know is a platform or an application\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well right now we're an application but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we're coming out with an api so like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 someone's going to make mm-hmm for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dentists\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like is that an application on on top of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 zoom\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah like all like whenever there's this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 big social change\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a technological change like we saw with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dot com like we saw with mobile\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's a giant you know feeding frenzy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like no one knows what's a platform\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what's an application\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no one knows who's a competitor who's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 partner yeah it's you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's all just there's a lot of like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's a lot of churn and then it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 takes a couple years to figure it out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so we'll see where it all lands it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super interesting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and um you know on the on the first\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 point i was speaking to a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 psychologist recently and we've all had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this experience of spending all day and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 zoom and you feel completely exhausted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 by the end of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and his explanation for that is as a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 part of your brain which is very used to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of subconscious cues which you pick\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 up on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in you know in sort of like face to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 face interaction\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and that's completely missing um when it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 comes to zoom\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 unless you kind of you know you get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the sort of the heart emojis and so on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 where\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you can use technology to kind of fill\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the gaps a little bit and um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah just make make the experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 better and a bit more human so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really yeah it's it's not but not trying\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to make it the same i think it's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 complete dead end to try to make a video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the same as in real life and it's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dead end to even try to make it closer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to real life like the point is not to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 get deeper and deeper into the uncanny\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 valley\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the point is to jump over the uncanny\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 valley and make the video experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something different but something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 amazing and something that in some ways\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is better so yeah like the heart emoji\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know this is big hands mode so like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah if i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like the next time i'm i'm meeting with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 someone in person like not on video\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which is going to be pretty soon because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i just got my i got my second vaccine\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 shot\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 two weeks ago so like as of tomorrow\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm fully vaccinated\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 taking my first trip and eat at a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 restaurant and get my hair cut and so on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um so at some point i'm gonna actually\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meet with someone in person that hasn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happened in 14 months\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know and if i do that next time\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i have like a meeting and i want to like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 show that i agree with someone and i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 give them a thumbs up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like i just get my like puny bony\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 human thumb i'm going to be like hey\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what the hell cuz like it turns out i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 never want to see like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bony puny phil thumb i always want you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know big hulk thumb when i do a thumbs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but like that's that you know that's not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gonna work not on zoom or you know the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 next time i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if i'm you know saying thank you or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something right like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i i want i want this i don't want this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to not happen it's a bit of a trivial\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 example there's many other things that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that you can do in video that you can do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before that are like legit superpowers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really meaningful but it's also\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 important to have stuff like this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because yeah it just like gets you into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the mindset where like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you're not trying to duplicate the old\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reality you're trying to make a better\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 new reality that will sit\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that will coexist with the old reality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you'll be in the old reality when\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you need to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you'll be in the new reality where you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 need to be and you'll choose which one\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to be and based on which is better for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you right now yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 interesting times i'm super interested\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um to sort of change gears a little bit\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um yeah but still kind of on the on the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 topic of kind of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the times we're living through i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all turtles has been a distributed team\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for a little while now am i right insane\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 man\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well you know we were there's different\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 variations of this we were we always had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 offices we started all turtles\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we had we had central offices we had an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 office in san francisco tokyo and paris\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so right from the beginning we wanted to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be international and global\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but it wasn't like working from home it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was you know we just had three expensive\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 offices at three expensive cities with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 plants like open up other cities\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but as soon as the in march basically\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when the pandemic hit we all you know we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 started working fully distributed and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 then we kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know very soon after that we just we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gave up all the offices we said we're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 never going\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 back okay and how's that kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worked and i'm curious as to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know there's going to be probably a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 number of people in this call and a lot\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of our founders who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are are kind of struggling to to change\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gears in a sense right people are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are used to the kind of in-person uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 environment it's how they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 exert influence in subtle ways how they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 got informed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know without sort of um being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 necessarily proactive about it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and a lot of the the old kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 tricks of the trade maybe\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't work nearly as well in um in yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the new kind of asynchronous\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remote first hybrid future um how has\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the kind of transition worked for you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 guys and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 anything which has worked particularly\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well or not work particularly well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um that you think you know um yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's worth sharing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i mean i think there's there's been a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bunch of things um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one thing is we try to be pretty\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 intentional about uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what we are and and what we're not um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one kind of rule we had is um no one is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remote we're not actually a remote team\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um we're distributed which is a totally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 different thing um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and it pays to like it you know i'm not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 trying to like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be super precise with the language but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it it it pays to like meditate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on the difference between them uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 distributed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remote is this right remote is like you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know other people are having fun and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hanging out in the office but you're not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like you're remote like remote\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is fundamentally a disadvantage it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's it's it is always a second class\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 citizen um we're not remote we're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 distributed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when when you're distributed no one is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remote right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because what you're we're leaning into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this idea\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that um we're fully distributed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the way to the way that we that we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do that is i think like most people have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um this is a very natural kind of human\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reaction is our you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the portion of our brains that thinks\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about like negative things and risks is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more powerful older more established\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than you know the part of our brains\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that thinks about you know opportunities\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 almost always whenever there's like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 change um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know people fear it people resist it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and they immediately think about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all of the problems that it creates and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how to mitigate those problems\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and so 99 really like literally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 probably i mean i haven't quantified it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but it feels like 99\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe maybe closer to 100. of all the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 conversation that i've heard in the past\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 few months about distributed is entirely\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 negative it's couched even people who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are saying that we're going to do it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's couched in the negative it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 couched as remote\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then it's cash as well but like how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yes but like it's not as good as being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in person for mentorship so how are we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to deal with that and how are we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to deal with you know people not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 seeing each other and is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 isn't this going to be harder and this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is not going to be harder so it's like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's all like the problem solving\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the problem solving is like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 important and interesting but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it can't be a hundred percent of what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you think about um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in fact it probably shouldn't even be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fifty percent of what you think about uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so what we try to do is we try to focus\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on on the superpowers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that we have by being distributed what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are the things that we could never do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that we can do now that are so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 foundationally important that we are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 never giving them up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like you you will never take these new\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 superpowers away from me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and from any of us and they're worth\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fighting for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and they're worth problem solving for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we focus on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what the superpowers are and we know why\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we want to stay distributed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 then it's just a matter of okay now we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have to solve some problems and we have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to figure out how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but the how is it much easier to get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 once you kind of understand why\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that this is a positive thing we're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doing this not because we have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we don't have to we don't have to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 distributed we're doing it because we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 want to because it gives us\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 amazing crazy superpowers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that we're not giving up um and i don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 see this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 much in the conversation but i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's i think it's kind of sorely missing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know and and the superpowers are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 obvious right like um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 an easy one is just you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 zero percent of my of my team members uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 waste you know any time during the day\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 commuting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 zero percent no one in the company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 spends you know two hours a day\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sitting in traffic that's never happened\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before and i'm never giving that up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i mean just that and that's like a minor\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 superpower but just that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is world changing right like imagine if\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um imagine if somehow like in in uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in my company like magically you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 harry potter style like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no one no one ever had to commute before\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we spent the past 10 years like not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 commuting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then you know tomorrow i come into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the office this is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the ultimate reality where you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's no pandemic they say hey\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everyone um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gather around i have a ceo idea i'm\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gonna need each of you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to waste two hours every day sitting in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 traffic\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like yes i know it's not productive\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because you can't get any work done and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yes i know that you're not spending that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 time with your friends or family\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and yes it's pretty unhealthy and yes\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's terrible for the environment\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but two hours a day all of you sitting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in traffic from now on let's go\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all right like the board would be like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ceo's going crazy would be fired\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 immediately\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um but you know that's what companies\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are asking people to do when they're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like oh let's all head back to the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 office like well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 obviously some people have to because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you have to do the work in person but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it ought to be criminal to force a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 software engineer or designer to sit two\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hours in traffic every day why the hell\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would you do that why would you give up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this new superpower\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 oh because you know oh but this is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 harder and that's harder well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah they are so now let's figure out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how to fix them when we know why we're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like we know what we're fighting for we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know what the superpowers are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and again the traffic one is like is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like minor compared to the rest of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every ceo of any reasonably successful\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 company will whine endlessly\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i've done it myself um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about how the hardest thing is always\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hiring really brilliant people and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 keeping brilliant people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like this is what you're supposed to say\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they teach you this in ceo school but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 never anyone asks what's the hardest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 part you always say\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 oh it's always hiring and you know and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's always recruiting and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and retaining really brilliant people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's like you have to say that it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 legally required if you're a ceo anyone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 asks you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you have to say it's the people and it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 true most of the time\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 okay granted true new superpower\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i am never again writing a job\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 description that says looking for a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 machine learning engineer in san\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 francisco\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 looking for a graphic designer like in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 london never saying that again\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 100 of our job descriptions now and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we've got like 30 of them open\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they all say global why would i ever\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 give that up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i've just i've just expanded the top of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the funnel for for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for brilliant you know candidates by 10\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 000\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 x something like that over putting a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 geographic description\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 here here me and all of my you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 other ceos have been whining for decades\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about how the hardest part is recruiting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we've been granted this amazing perfect\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 solution to how to make that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 infinitely easier and we're like nah we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 still want to go back to the office\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 okay and again and even that's not the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 biggest one there's like there's other\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 superpowers that are even bigger but i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most important thing is like rather than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 saying this is a temporary thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we're doing it because we have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we can't wait to go back to the way\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 things were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 think about well if what what are the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 amazing new powers that we have how is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our lives in our world much better if we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 embrace this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then how do we problem solve and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 then of course some companies will still\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have to decide to go back to the office\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because some of them have to because you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know the work they do requires it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 many more will do it just because you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know they're dumb\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but that's fine it'll you know the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 world will shake itself out and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we'll see where things land that's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really powerful way of framing it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 actually\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know the status quo kind of feels a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 little bit absurd when you uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when you kind of paint that picture and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 look people are right now like we've all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 been we've all been traumatized by being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forced\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to not see each other by sit at home of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 course it feels terrible\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything feels terrible if you're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forced to do it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like obviously and of course people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are going to go through over the next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 couple of months this like amazing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 freedom\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like oh i can't wait to like you know to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 go back to the office because you know i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 want to see people again and i'm so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 tired of sitting at home and not going\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 anywhere\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well yeah right because you were forced\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to and by the way like being a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 distributed team doesn't mean you sit at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 home\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like in fact i'm quite looking forward\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to like going to restaurants and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 traveling i'm what i'm not looking\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forward to is like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sitting in traffic for two hours so that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i could get to a big room and wear\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 headphones\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know so that other people don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't disturb me like that that i'm not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 looking forward to but but even that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe i'll do that once in a while but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like that as soon as we transition from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doing something because we're forced to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to picking and choosing and having\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 agency about oh i want to do this thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like this and i want to do this thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like this it completely changes\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything right like a a few years ago\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know this was a thing that people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 used to ask me a lot about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was um you know i i got into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fasting right i started to like take\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 health a little bit more seriously i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lost a bunch of weight\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and fasting then i don't normally talk\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about it much because you know we don't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have any fasting related products so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's not useful for me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but some people when they ask me about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this they're like oh man isn't that like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 terrible like you're like like you're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 starving and like well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no because like the intentionality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 matters a lot\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like there is a world of difference\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 between\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not eating when i decide i don't want to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 eat and having the full\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 power to eat whenever i want and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 deciding what feels right and what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doesn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like not having enough food like not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 having enough food is a horrible thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that needs to be eradicated from the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 world like nothing could be further than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that than having the agency\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of basically just like choosing they're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 totally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're totally disconnected and like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the the the that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the giant bridge like that you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 between them is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is is the agency it's the intentionality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so yes like i completely acknowledge\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that being in video because you had to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be because we also work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 home was a terrible thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know over the next few months sure\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like let's figure out how to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rebalance it but i am 100 convinced\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that a lot of people us included and all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of our companies are just going to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like yeah well okay let's let's take the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lessons we learned of what really works\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the new superpowers and being into\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 them because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we do it because we want to you know i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 mean we we get to experience remote work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when life is back to normal\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah the best is kind of yet to come in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in so many respects\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we've yet to destroy most of us the vat\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know 99\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of the of the population has not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 experienced distributed work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 by choice they've only experienced\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remote work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's been forced on them and like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 those two things have nothing in common\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super interesting i want to come back to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the intentionality point maybe a little\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bit later but i would love to just pick\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your brains a little bit or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hear the story of kind of all turtles\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right it's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 mission-driven product studio we'll\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be curious of what what is the mission\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is there kind of thesis\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 behind all turtles sort of what's um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah where where did where did it kind\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of come from and uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah what is that what is that mission\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah i mean we published um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i wrote a thing right at the beginning\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of it on linkedin which is kind of still\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 up there i think it's called like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 silicon valley method isn't enough that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of outlines the mission but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the the main the main idea is uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 look like as you said in the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 introduction you know i'm old i've spent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decades at this point um uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like every part of startup life\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right like i've started five companies\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i've sold a bunch of companies i've\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 invested i've been in vc\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like so i've bought companies like i've\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 done like all all the different parts of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and it's most of it right like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the whole like silicon valley style like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startup vc treadmill\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is um it works great for a very\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 small number of people sometimes and it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 works great for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 some vcs um but it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 parts of it on the face of it are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ridiculously inefficient um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the main one is that it fetishizes\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startups\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which like just that like doesn't make\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sense that's kind of the central point\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right it's like we don't care about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startups\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we don't care about making startups at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all turtles we're indifferent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to startups we care about the products\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we want there to be successful products\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if the best way for that product to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reach its full potential is to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 instantiated inside of an independent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 great like with we can make that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decision the other thing against\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startups we're just saying like that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not the goal\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like making a corporate entity\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of a startup is not is not in and of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 itself a virtuous thing or a goal\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it is a tool that is sometimes the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 appropriate tool\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and sometimes not um imagine like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 imagine if you were are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like a mozart level one in a million\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most like brilliant naturally gifted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 musicians in the world like i like today\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 let's just say you're like 100 million\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 mozart level\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know musical genius you don't have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to make a music company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right you just play and the platforms\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 already exist you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 youtube and whatever that you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you'll get out to a billion people if\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you're really that good\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um if you're like one of the most\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 brilliant you know writers in the world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you don't have to like start a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a writing company you're just right if\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you're one of the most brilliant\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 filmmakers in the world you don't have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to like start a film studio as your\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 first step\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know you go and you work on you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 medieval korean zombie\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 series on netflix like that's what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you want to do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but if you're one of these like one\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a million most talented\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know mozart level like product\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 visionaries\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you have to make a startup first we tell\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 oh okay yeah yeah great great great idea\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kid here's the here's the wikipedia page\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and how to make a startup this is where\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 498 valuation means go get yourself a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 board of directors go make 10 000\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 mistakes the same way go like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hire some people get sued you know raise\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 money\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do all the things that have nothing to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do with your idea or nothing to do with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your product that are really hard that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you're going to screw up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and probably fail which is why 99 or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 whatever startups fail\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 except like you'll fail for like an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 utterly uninteresting reason because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it'll have nothing to do with your idea\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your idea will never even get tested\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because like the first step for some\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reason\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 as a society we've been like okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 brilliant musician step one play some\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 music okay brilliant writer step one\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 write some stuff okay brilliant\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 filmmakers step one go make a movie okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 brilliant product person step one make a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 become a mediocre ceo of a brittle\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 little\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 company first then we'll talk about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 whether your product is married\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's kind of asinine who does it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 benefit well you know it benefits\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a certain class of vc certainly doesn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 benefit the founder certainly doesn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 benefit the broader community of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 investors certainly doesn't benefit the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we want to make it better so we just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 want to have a different a different\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 structure\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a different structure for making\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worthwhile\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 products with as little nonsense as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 possible\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then if if once we have once we know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that those products once there's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something to it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um then if they need to become companies\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they become companies\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and if they don't then they don't and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we don't fetishize you know one path\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 versus the other\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we just care about making the product so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that that's an overly long summary of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 interesting where did those product\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ideas and concepts come from are they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of coming from the team\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they come you know are you working with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 founders who are bringing you ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah i mean a little of everything um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like one thing that i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a lot of people who've like kind of in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the industry you know know is that ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not that useful or valuable meaning\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that there's just so many good ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know as a vc um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so you know i i i after evernote i i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thought you know i would\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i would become a vc i joined general\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 catalyst as as a managing director\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and learned a ton but it but the main\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thing i learned is that like i wasn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 very good at that job\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like being a really good vc and i worked\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with many really good vcs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it was like a very specific skill set\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i just like i wasn't good at it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i wasn't interested in becoming good\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at it because like when i kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 realized what it was i was like oh okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's a different that's a different\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um but as a as a you know investor in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a you know you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a relatively top tier fund um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i i very rarely saw stupid ideas like i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i counted the number of companies the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 number of startups that i interacted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with a year and it was about it's about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 three thousand so basically i interacted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with about three thousand startups a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 year and still do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe slightly less now but the fewer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 now but it's still you know a few\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thousand but three thousand\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when i was professionally an investor of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 those three thousand\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i would like i would probably take\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meetings with five or six hundred\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i would invest in three so you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know that funnel was like 3 000 pitches\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know three investments and of those\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 3000 pitches how many were dumb ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not that many you know maybe a third\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 were just like ideas where i'm like well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's stupid\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like there's a lot of good ideas out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there the ideas are barely you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what's important it always comes down to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who are the founders what's the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 execution like what are the marketing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 conditions kind of what you know what's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all that other stuff maybe there's just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like a lot of really stupid ideas but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but they don't get to us right like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're filtered out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more organically so um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 where do we get ideas from it almost\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doesn't matter\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i come up with a bunch of ideas other\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 team members do founders\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know come to us with ideas big\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 companies have ideas we actually partner\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with big big companies they have a lot\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of like brilliant people who are stuck\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 inside who have like all sorts of ideas\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um so there's never a shortage of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ideas but there's a shortage of is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really brilliant passionate people who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can execute and so like that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we get those from all the same places we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we hire them ourselves we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we attract really early stage teams we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 work with big companies we assemble\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 from other institutions so it's it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really much more about the the the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the assembling the team and the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 execution than you know than the idea\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know what was the idea of like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah what was the idea of evernote\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evernote was like evernote was like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe the lamest idea in technology the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evernote idea was literally like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we're going to let you write things down\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with a computer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like that hardly the first time that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's been that's been tried\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right the idea is not it's not is not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the main thing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super interesting and you know i'd like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to just pick up on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you spoke about ceo score it kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 does it doesn't exist and i suspect a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lot of ceos probably wish it did\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know maybe the best place they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can learn from maybe are people who've\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of done this once twice or kind\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of five times so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe one way of phrasing it might be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if i ask somebody who kind of works for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you how would they characterize\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your your kind of management style or or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ceo kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like nature\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there is no way i'm gonna like fall for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that like nothing nothing good can come\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 from me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know putting words in the mouth of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people that you might allegedly ask\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about my you know my management style\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how would you kind of characterize it um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i i i've learned a few important things\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 over the years um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one is that as a ceo\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the people who evaluate me investors\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 board members\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't care at all i get no credit\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for stuff i do i only get credit for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the team that i keep so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like the only because that's the only\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 scalable thing so you know you see me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doing like like wacky\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 youtube videos demoing the product like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that isn't a thing that like i need to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be doing that's the thing that i'm doing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right now because it's effective\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know it helps with the company but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no one like my board is not a value\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 based on that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's not evaluating based on how witty i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 am or how good any of this stuff is it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evaluating exclusively on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how impressive and effective are the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people that i'm like assembling and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 managing to keep around\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are um and that's it because because you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know it makes sense right nothing else\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 matters because nothing else scalable\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like if i'm trying to be impressive\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 personally than that that i'm failing as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a ceo because like there's only one of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 me i can only scale so far\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i have to be able to assemble a team of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people who are far more better than i am\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who are far more impressive than i am at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 their\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know at their particular things and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if i could do that and i can keep them\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 around\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know then like then that then that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everything then that's like then then\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know halfway decent ceo um so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i've you know i like that's how i try to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to do it i basically try to say well my\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 job is to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know set the vision\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make sure that there's amazingly\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 talented people much smarter and better\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than i am\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i have to be the dumbest person at the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 company like this guy it's an inverted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 pyramid\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 everyone else has to be much better much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more effective\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then make sure there's enough money\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the bank so if i do those three\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 things i control the vision and make\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sure there's an amazing team\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i have enough money in the bank then\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like that's it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm successful and so the greatest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 feeling for me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 as a as a ceo which happens more and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more but like this is what i've sort of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 trained myself to just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 love like the thing that makes me\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happiest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is when i see something that the team\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 did\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's great that i didn't even know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about they were doing or i barely knew\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like the thing that makes me the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happiest is when i like you know i was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gonna say walk into the office but that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doesn't happen anymore but when i like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 see some the result of some work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i was like wow that's really good\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the less i knew about it or did it the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 better because like the ultimate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 scalable thing is like you know every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 day i like look on slack\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and i just see this amazing stuff and i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 didn't ask for it to be done i didn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know it was being worked on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it just like it just happened that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happens once in a while\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not you know not every day but almost\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every day now i see examples of things\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that were like really high quality that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i didn't have to like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do that much for maybe i maybe i knew\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about it maybe i asked for it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then the worst thing is like if i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have to like do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stuff myself not because i don't like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 doing it i do i actually find it like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 actually like i find it therapeutic to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do stuff myself so i like i occasionally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well i'll write stuff i'll do stuff by\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stuff i'll make videos that's more of a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 way of like staying sane\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i find that very pleasurable but but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's not being a ceo that's not that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not being good at my job being good at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 my job is like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know working myself out of a job\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think that's great great advice um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well we'll turn over to questions in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just a minute but um maybe one last\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 question before we do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it what what do you what do you kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know now that you wish you'd known in in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know maybe 1997 or you know you what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of advice would you give your to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 your 20 something your yourself\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know that maybe some of us could\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be taken away\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like if i had a time machine or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i had a time machine and go back to my\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 20 year old self and i'd be like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dude don't worry about anything it's all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to be okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because in 30 years you're going to have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a time machine so like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no no the rest of this doesn't matter i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 think i think i would have had a much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more relaxed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 next 30 years at that point i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really quickly then you you mentioned\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 intentionality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know your the career part that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you've kind of had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 quite a kind of varied one in a sense so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 an intentionality versus serendipity but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 these things how have you kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 balanced that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um you know how intentional are you with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with these kind of big decisions you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make around career launching products\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 versus you know to what degree do they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just sort of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know common you know do you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 engineer this sort of serendipity or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be curious i said how do you think about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well i mean i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think there's um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 one of the things that i worried about\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most when we became fully distributed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and started working from home\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is um i worried a lot about um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the the serendipitous or the kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 impromptu\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 off-the-cuff decision-making style\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i wouldn't be able to do that anymore um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i was very much an in-person impromptu\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decision-making person like a lot of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 important decisions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the company we made because i would like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 walk by someone's that's going to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like hey let's go let's go walk for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 coffee\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we'd go walk for coffee and we'd decide\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something important and then it would\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 happen\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so i was not a fan of video meetings at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all in fact i banned evernote i banned\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 video meetings at like the board they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 basically like told\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for important meetings i'm like look\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 show up in person or don't show up i'm\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not going to like degrade the experience\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for everyone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 having a dial in and it was very much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like an off the cuff impromptu\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 face to face go walk for coffee decide\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 life-changing things and i was really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worried\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um that you know i wouldn't be able to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do that how would i how would i function\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how would the team function and i was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right to worry because like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you really it's much harder to do that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in a distributed world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and but then it turned out that that was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 part of the problem\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like my like you know seed of the pants\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 cowboy pew pew let's go walk coffee and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 make decisions actually was a shitty way\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to run a company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know i was probably succeeding\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 somewhat not because of that but in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 spite of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like other things were happening well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like the team was good enough where like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in spite of that kind of slap dash\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know inconsistent style we were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 still doing okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and like not being able to do it and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 having to be like oh well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 okay i can't do that anymore i have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like document things more i have to be a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 little bit more thoughtful about this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but like but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what amazing superpowers that gives us\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because all of a sudden like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people that that that i wouldn't have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gone to have coffee with because they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 either physically weren't there or like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 honestly like there was people that i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would hang out with because they were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fun to walk with and other people that i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 wouldn't necessarily do it like we're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all just human\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and so the people who happen to be my\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 coffee walking companions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like had a certain experience and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 contribute to the company and the people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who didn't didn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 regardless of how brilliant they were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and all of a sudden when like when that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was removed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i was getting a lot more like brilliance\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and productivity from from everyone else\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because it wasn't about who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who goes for coffee with the ceo it was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about you know who has\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who has the best idea who can\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 communicate it clearly who can you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 who can execute it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and so when we shift it from random\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 impromptu walks with phil to okay let's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do this in figma\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it became a lot better it didn't feel as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 good in the beginning\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because i was like man i like i like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 feeling of like yeah i'm just gonna have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this you know steve jobsi and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 strut around and get coffee and make\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 important decisions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but once we started seeing the results\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the results were better like that that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 feels even better like i'd much rather\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be at a company that's more successful\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than being a company where you get to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 act out whatever whatever steve jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fantasy you know i would have had before\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so it's like a lot of it is about that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's about like what i used to consider\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like serendipitous like yeah maybe it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was maybe it wasn't maybe it was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 actually getting in the way\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right maybe this is the success paradox\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 oh this person has these weird habits\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and they're successful therefore they're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 successful because of these weird habits\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like no they're not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe they would have been even more\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 successful if they hadn't had these\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 weird habits right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and i think the pandemic like forced\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 us to recalibrate that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know where we land now is i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 think healthier at least if we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 intentionally say\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this is massive change everything is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 getting thrown up in the air\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but we're gonna reassemble the pieces in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a way that's gonna make it better than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 before\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and if we do that intentionally then we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can do it if we don't then yeah they're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all gonna like they're gonna get\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reassembled\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in some other sub-optimal unfair way um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but yeah that's kind of how so i've like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i started to questioning a lot of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a lot of the you know preparation\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meeting luck or whatever\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like dogma as yeah maybe maybe not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah excellent um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well i might open up open the sort of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 floor to questions we've we've got one\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the chat from feroz who's a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 founder in our fintech sector and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you kind of ask what what do you what do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you worry about regarding the future\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 success of um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or kind of evernote when it was at the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 same stage\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i mean i worry about a lot of stuff you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know i'm like i'm naturally a warrior\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it isn't that productive\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um so really it's about like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know it's about for my own like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 mental health and productivity how do i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like how do i embrace that aspect of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worrying about a lot of stuff but not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 let it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know not let it go to an unhealthy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 place not let it you know drain too much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 energy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because you know worry really doesn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like it doesn't sit well in startups\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like you need for startup you need a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 huge amount of activation energy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and you know i think the main\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 difference between\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 something operating very\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entrepreneurially and and not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is you know entrepreneurship and the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 classic definition\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 things by stevenson or something is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entrepreneur entrepreneurship is the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 pursuit of opportunity without regard\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for resources currently controlled\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 basically means that like which explains\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 why startups are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can be entrepreneurial because they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't control any resources there's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 nothing to protect and so like you see\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 an opportunity and you're like right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how am i going to get there but you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't think about like starting with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what i currently\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 own how do i extend it you think of like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how do i get there i don't own anything\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's nothing to protect how do i get\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there bigger companies bigger\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 institutions find it much harder because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they control quite a lot of stuff they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have a lot of resources so they're\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're clearly saying like how do i how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do i manage these resources how do i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how do i grow them like entrepreneurship\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is not about nurturing something it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not about growing like a seedling\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because you don't have anything you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 adequate like proper high quality\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 management of a big company is much more\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 about like okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what are the seeds that i've planted\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what are the resources that i have how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do we how do we grow them how do we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how do we nurture them different mindset\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and um in startup land where you're just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 creating\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you have nothing that's worth saving it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if if if your startup fails it's okay if\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 my startup fails\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like for the world and and for me and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for the employees it's okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like most people you know that are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 employed can get other jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every you know no one no one is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 penalized in their career for having\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worked at a startup that fails i mean\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at least not in most parts of the world\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right now that we that we deal with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and like honestly we haven't built\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 anything yet that's worth saving that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worth fighting for so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all we have all we're trying to do is to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be creative and to make something that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 will at some point be worth protecting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and worth worrying about but right now\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we don't have that yet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and when we get there we'll be a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 different kind of company and we maybe\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 won't be a startup anymore\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and it'll require a very different\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of management philosophy which\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know maybe maybe i'll be the right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 person for maybe it won't be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um but initially in startup land like i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worry about everything and then i just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then i don't i don't i try not to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 act on my worries because they're not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the productive way to do something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know to do something unexpected and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 great\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sounds like a conclusion that was hard\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 reached but probably um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but what a valuable takeaway for for a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lot of our founders\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um janine's asking what are the kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 key tips for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 when raising early um i guess your your\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um your recent funding round is uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 maybe maybe kind of enabled by the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fact that you know you've already had a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 huge amount of success was it was it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like that when when you were\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 raising for evernote what what what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would you kind of suggest to founders\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to be trying to raise early early seed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rounds and um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah well i don't think i've had a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 huge amount of success i think i've had\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a moderate amount of success um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i think look i think raising money is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 not an accomplishment\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um it's just not like it isn't something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to be to be proud of it's not something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to celebrate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 raising money if anything is an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 obligation like now you just have an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 obligation to more people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like they have entrusted you with money\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that that you know you're now supposed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 turn into more money um so i definitely\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i could definitely try to stay away from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and encourage others to stay away from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 this like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 culture that that sees fundraising as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 some kind of a goal or something to be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 celebrated because it isn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's an important step sometimes for you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know certain types of ways that you want\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to pursue ideas it's an important step\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but it's not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's not in and of itself success we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 don't want to fetishize\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fundraising this is this fetishizing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fetishizing fundraising comes from the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 same place as fetishizing startups it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a very like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 vc you know every round getting marked\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 up mentality it's not actually good for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 founders\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so kind of get that out of the way um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in terms of raising yeah i mean\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um was the fastest fundraise i've ever\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 seen\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or been involved with it took a few days\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 literally i think from from when i first\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 talked to roloff to when we had the seed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 round uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 term sheet it was like three days um you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know i basically\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i texted him hey um i made a thing i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 want to show it to you i'm not sure what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to do with it yet you want to take a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 look\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 jumped on a zoom call show you know gave\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 him a very quick demo\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 he was like oh this is really cool yeah\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you should totally raise money for this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 come talk to my other partners i said\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 okay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 he set up a meeting two days later i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 thought it was going to be like two or\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 three other partners i zoomed into it it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was like the entire partnership there\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 was like 30 of them\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i did the demo i don't have a pitch deck\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um i did that they did the demo they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gave me a term sheet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um and then the around came came around\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 just just about as fast a few months\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 later and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um evernote was the exact opposite at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 evernote i spoke to several hundred\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 investors before we got money um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no one no one in silicon valley\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 invested in us at evernote in the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 beginning\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sequoia did eventually but that was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 already the b round um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 step on and i funded a lot of it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ourselves plus we had like literally\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 friends and family\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it was it was my third company it was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like stephon's third or fourth company\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we were lucky in that we were able to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know to get some cash around but but\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it with a hundred they had hundreds of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 vc meetings\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it took forever i literally raised\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 money at evernote in kazan\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which is in you know in tartar stan\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's where target sauce comes from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because yeah wasn't there weren't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people in in in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on sand hill rolls giving us money um i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 think the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but then it got easier then like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 after we actually had some traction then\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it became\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know vastly easy so like i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the first like five million dollars just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ever know took like 95\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of the effort and then like the other\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 400 million that i raised in the next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 few years took like five percent of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 effort\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um i think the sweet spot um if you can\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do it and the reason that like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 went fast and um that evernote went\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really fast\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 after it went really slow like after we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 kind of got to this inflection point is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 there's really kind of two things\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and usually you can't do this i just got\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i've been fortunate enough to be able to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do this twice because other things i've\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 raised money for didn't have these two\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 things they took much longer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like all turtles the old turtles wasn't\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 very fast at all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um the two things are um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you want the investors to see the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 potential\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the big picture potential and find it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 plausible so like when i was doing the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 jazz hands you know the the the vcs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 looking at it were like okay yeah i can\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 see how this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how this is a multi-trillion dollar\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 industry like they don't have to think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's definitely gonna happen but they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can see the potential of this entire\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rewrite of the world everything being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hybrid they get they they understand\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they think it's plausible\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 combined with they all want to use the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 product today\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all of them every single person i showed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it to early on was like where can i get\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that i want to use that right now i want\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to use it with my kids i want to use it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with portfolio companies i want it for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 myself i want to use this right now\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for myself and when you like have the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 venn diagram intersection of that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like they can they can understand the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 potential that again they don't have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 like super believe it because again at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 early stage no one is investing because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they think it's likely to be true\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're investing because it might be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 really true\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and they think it's a shot worth taking\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so they see the potential\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and then but they also like immediate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they don't have to they don't have to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 imagine who would use it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they would use it they would use it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 themselves they want to use it right now\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we had the same thing in evernote once\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we actually had like a ship product and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the iphone version\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 once we were demoing it we were demoing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 how like yeah you put this on your mac\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 now you can look at it on your phone and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you can take a picture of a business\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 card and you can search for it by name\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 all of the vcs were like yeah i they\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 already were using it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 or they wanted to use it and so like the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 problem with evernote was they always\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 wanted to use it but they couldn't see\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the potential at first\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because we sucked up describing it and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we didn't have any stats\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but once we kind of got both of those\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 circles and the venn diagram\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 intersection came into focus then then\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it went fast and it came into focus much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 faster because\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know the potential is easier to see\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and everyone wants to use it so i think\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 if you have that that's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that's the cheat code unfortunately like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 most\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 companies people don't have that right\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 because like again if you're selling\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dog food like unless you're pitching to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dogs like they're not gonna be like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rough right like it's not for them\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they're gonna have to imagine something\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know unless you happen to be making\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a product that like vcs are the target\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 audience which\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you know for and for evernote they kind\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of both were you can't really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you can't avail yourself of this cheat\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 code\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 super interesting phil feels how we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 could\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 keep talking for um for a while longer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 but i think we\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would come to the end of our a lot of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 time\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um i think there's a few more questions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the chat as well but um\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 perhaps um you know perhaps we can come\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 back to this at another time maybe when\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 you want to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 yeah you're at a six seven eight or nine\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 startup maybe earlier\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um hopefully not you know i never i like\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every job i've ever had i've i've really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 wanted it to be the last thing i do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right i really never thought i'd do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 anything after evernote i thought i ever\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know my life's work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i left evernote i joined general\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 catalyst i thought that i thought being\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a vc was going to be it that was going\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to take me into retirement that was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 going to be my life's work and then old\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hurdles\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i certainly wasn't even looking to start\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 again that was a joke i mean\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 joke was kind of on us by us but you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 know so yeah i really\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i appreciate what you're trying to say i\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hope there is not a startup number six\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 seven and eight because it's\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it's kind of exhausting for the you know\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for for people who can't help but build\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 right the world would be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a a much poorer place um without them so\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 um yeah we really appreciate you\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 spending your time with us\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 i'm really excited to see what you do\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 next with uh\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and thank you again}
